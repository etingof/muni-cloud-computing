* Recap of Cloud Types

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  -  More detailed in Cloud Service Deliver Models
  -  Datacenter Virtualization -- oVirt
  -  IaaS -- Infrastructure as a Service -- OpenStack
  -  PaaS -- Platform as a Servise - OpenShift
  -  SaaS -- Software as a Service -- Microsoft Dynamics CRM -- mostly
    abandoned
  -  xPaaS -- extended PaaS -- integrates aPaaS (Application), iPaaS
    (Integration), dvPaaS (Data Virtualization), bpmPaaS (Business
    Process Management), mPaaS (Mobile)

* Amazon

**  AWS
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Amazon Web Services
   - Web service backend providing libraries for majority of modern web programming languages
   - Provides also database access and storage
   - Features mobile platform as well
   - REST-style HTTP, SOAP

**  S3
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Simple Storage Service
   - Provides API-driven Object storage
   - Stored files are abstracted all the way to objects and are easy to
    represent in high-level programming languages
   - REST-style HTTP, SOAP, BitTorrent

**  EC2
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Elastic Compute Cloud (IaaS)
   - KVM-based
   - Provides backend to earlier mentioned services as well as ability to
    sell „Virtual private cloud“ to customers
   - OSs (Linux, OpenSolaris, Windows, NetBSD, ...)
  
** Other
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS)
   - AWS Lambda (event-driven, serverless computing - FaaS)
   - Glacier (storage for archives or backups)
   - Elastic Block Store (block-level storage)
   - SimpleDB, DynamoDB, Elastic MapReduce, ...

* Google

* Cloud Platform
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Rich platform exposing functionality over REST
 - Primarily developed to support Google's core services (search, youtube, gmail)
 - Later extended with the business needs driven by Android, its integration with services
 - Nowadays featuring rich set of programming frameworks, hosting services and database engines
   
* App Engine
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Web apps on Google's infrastructure (PaaS)
 - Python, Java (JVM), Go, PHP, Node.js
 - Easy deploy, monitoring, scaling
 - Limited languages and tools (SQL vs. GQL)

* Compute Engine
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - IaaS
 - Compute Engine Unit (GCEU) - abstraction of computation power
 - at the backend kvm based

* Storage
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - IaaS for storage
 - REST-like HTTP access
 - compatible with Amazon S3

* BigQuery
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - web service (with REST-like interface)
 - work with Storage
 - SQL dialect, returns JSON
 - can be integrated via HTTP (Spreadsheets)

* Red Hat
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  -  Provider of solutions that can serve either as a private or public
    cloud
  -  Also provider of PaaS/xPaaS solution (OpenShift)
  -  Involved in development of cloud-oriented apps ranging from Level 1
    (kernel, KVM), through management software (OpenStack, oVirt) and
    PaaS up to application level (Jboss Enterprise Application Platform,
    Data Virtualization, etc.)

* oVirt
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - open source upstream for Red Hat Virtualization
 - can manage networks, CPUs, storages
 - with VM it can do live migration, live snapshots
 - integrate with many open source projects (OpenStack, Foreman, ManageIQ, ...)

** oVirt Engine
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Java (GWT, WildFly)
 - REST-style HTTP API
 - can integrate with LDAP or AD

** oVirt Node
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - RHEL, CentOS, Fedora or Debian with KVM
 - VDSM (Python daemon) manages resources and VMs
 - gets commands from Engine and reports back to it

* OpenStack
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - open source platform for cloud computing (mainly IaaS)
 - written in Python
 - each Project aims to solve one part of cloud computing needs
 - pluggable w/r/t backends and between Projects

** Identity (Keystone)
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - central user management and authentication service
 - can use directory service backend (LDAP)

** Compute (Nova)
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - layer on top of hypervisor(s)
 - manages compute resources - VMs and containers

** Networking (Neutron)
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - manages networks and IP addresses for VMs
 - can use SDN technologies (OpenFlow)
 - load balancing, floating IPs, firewall, VPN, ...
  
** Other
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Block Storage (Cinder) - many storage providers
 - Image Storage (Glance) - images to boot from and to store snapshots of VMs to
 - Orchestration (Heat) - used to manage deployments of applications on OS
 - Database as a Service (Trove)
 - Bare Metal (Ironic) - management of physical machines (PXE and IPMI as default)
 
* OpenShift
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - PaaS
 - container based deployment and management
 - Kubernetes with Docker images
 - written in Go
