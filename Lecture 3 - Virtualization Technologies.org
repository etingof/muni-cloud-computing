* Virtualization

* Warm-up
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - What is cloud computing?
 - Cloud traits?
 - Cloud deployment models?

* What is cloud computing?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 1. Usage model of computer resources
 2. Networked computers
 3. Distributed computing technology
 4. A collection of heterogeneous computers

* Cloud traits?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 1. High availability
 2. On-demand self-service
 3. High performance
 4. Broad network access
 5. Resource pooling
 6. Rapid elasticity
 7. Measured Service

* Cloud service models?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 1. Software as a Service
 2. Application as a Service
 3. Platform as a Service
 4. Infrastructure as a Service
 5. Data as a Service

* Cloud deployment models
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 1. Public Cloud
 2. Private Cloud
 3. Hybrid Cloud
 4. Personal Cloud
 5. Community Cloud
 6. Enterprise Cloud

* History of virtualization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - How old is virtualization?

* History of virtualization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Early 1960: batch processing
 - 1967: first time-sharing system - IBM S/370-67
 - 2005: Intel VT-x, AMD-V - new instruction set
 - 2005-: VMware, VirtualBox, KVM...

* What exactly is virtualization?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Multi-threading vs multi-tasking vs virtualization?
 - Containers vs OS virtualization
 - CPUs: Multi-core vs Hyper-threading

* How did virtualization work before 2005?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Well, sloooowly...

* Is it cloud already?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - What is virtualization?
 - What is cloud?

* Is it cloud already?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Hypervisors
 - Virtualization management and services

* Cloud features
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  Easy provisioning and configuration
 -  Movable resource: snapshot/backup
 -  Consolidation of resources: scale up/down

** Cloud features
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  Isolation from host HW and OS
 -  Virtual vs Physical machine monitoring
 -  Easier testing and evaluation
 -  Duplication of environments

* Hypervisors
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Native or bare-metal
 - Hosted
 - Full or para-virtualization

** Hypervisors
[[./hyperviseur.png]]

* Examples of native hypervisors
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  XEN
 -  MS Hyper-V
 -  VMware ESXi

* Examples of hosted hypervisors
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - QEMU
 - KVM
 - VirtualBox
 - VMware Workstation
 - FreeBSD bhyve

* XEN
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - founded in 2003 by XenSource, bought in 2007 by Citrix
 - 2013 under Linux Foundation as Xen Project
 - native hypervisor

* ZEN
[[./xen.png]]

* KVM
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Modular kernel virtualization
 - provides user space access to hw virtualization
 - started by Qumranet
 - 2007 merged into linux kernel

* KVM
[[./kvm.png]]

* QEMU
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  hosted hypervisor
 -  provides CPU and/or hardware emulation
 -  can be used with KVM (hardware-only emulation)

* QEMU
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Other practical QEMU use-cases?

* Type 1 vs type 2 confusion
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Linux with KVM
 - FreeBSD with bhyve

* Full vs para-virtualization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Full: run unmodified OS image
 - Para: OS explicitly calls hypervisor

* Para-virtualization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Why?

** Why it's called Hypervisor?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - What's behind the name?

* Virtualization management
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Common API to different hypervisors
 - High-level VM lifecycle abstraction
 - Cloud services: networks, storage...

* Cloud services
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Automated network configuration


* Examples of virtualization managers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - libvirt
 - oVirt
 - OpenStack

* Libvirt
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Common API for hypervisor type abstraction supports
 - LXC
 - KVM/QEMU, Xen, VirtualBox
 - VMware ESXi and Workstation
 - MS Hyper-V, IBM PowerVM

* Libvirt
[[./libvirt.png]]

* oVirt
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  virtualization management platform
 -  on top of KVM
 -  upstream for RHV
 -  engine
 -  node
 -  VDSM - virtual desktop and server manager

* OpenStack
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - software platform for cloud computing
 - started in 2010 by Rackspace and NASA
 - in 2012 founded OpenStack Foundation

* OpenStack

* Hypervisors vs Containers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Hypervisors spawn VMs
 - Containers isolates apps to namespaces

* Example containers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Docker
 - LXC
 - OpenVZ
 - chroot

* Recap
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Why should we use virtualization?
 - What types of hypervisors we know? Any examples?
 - Name some projects that uses or build on top of hypervisor technologies?
