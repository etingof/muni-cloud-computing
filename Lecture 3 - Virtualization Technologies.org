* Virtualization
  
** Why?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  Consolidation of resources
 -  Virtual vs Physical machine inspection
 -  Easy provisioning
 -  Movable resource

** Why?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 -  Recoverable
 -  Easier testing and evaluation
 -  Duplication of environments
 -  Isolation from host HW and OS

* Hypervisors

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- native
- hosted
** Hypervisors

* Examples of native hypervisors

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  XEN
-  MS Hyper-V
-  VMware ESXi

* Examples of hosted hypervisors

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- QEMU
- KVM
- VirtualBox
- VMware Workstation

* XEN

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- founded in 2003 by XenSource, bought in 2007 by Citrix
- 2013 under Linux Foundation as Xen Project
- native hypervisor
* ZEN

* KVM

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Modular kernel virtualization
- provides user space access to hw virtualization
- started by Qumranet
- 2007 merged into linux kernel
* KVM
[[./kvm.png]]

* QEMU

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  hosted hypervisor
-  provides emulation of hw
-  can be used with KVM for hw virtualization

* Libvirt

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Common API for hypervisor type abstraction
- supports
- LXC
- KVM/QEMU, Xen, VirtualBox
- VMware ESXi and Workstation
- MS Hyper-V, IBM PowerVM
* Libvirt
[[./libvirt.png]]

* oVirt

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  virtualization management platform
-  on top of KVM
-  upstream for RHV
-  engine
-  node
-  VDSM - virtual desktop and server manager

* OpenStack

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- software platform for cloud computing
- started in 2010 by Rackspace and NASA
- in 2012 founded OpenStack Foundation

* Containers
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - Docker
 - LXC
 - OpenVZ
 - chroot

* Recap
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Why we should use virtualization?
   - What types of hypervisors we know? Any examples?
   - Name some projects that uses or build on top of hypervisor technologies.
